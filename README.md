# Determining Lunar orbit for PRATUSH (Probing ReionizATion of the Universe using Signal from Hydrogen)

1) "final_earth_quiet_cone"- to estimate Earth quiet cone.
2) "730 days"- to simulate the DARE mission orbit for 730 days
3) "Chandrayaan 2" - to simulate the chandrayaan 2 mission orbit
4) "Chandrayaan 2 equatorial" - to simulate the chandrayaan 2 mission orbit with 0 inclination
5) "inclination variation"- to simulate the spacecraft with a range of initial inclination values
6) "raan_inc"- to simulate the spacecraft with a range of initial RAAN and inclination values
7) full moon one day- to simulate spacecraft for one day only (on a full moon)
8) lunar month- to simulate the spacecraft for 1 lunar month (new moon to new moon)

9) images - contains images used in some notebooks.
